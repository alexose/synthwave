# Synthwave 3D Models

The following are a few notes on how to print this design. This is not meant to be a comprehensive tutorial. More of an
FAQ.

If you're having trouble with the build process, I encourage you to reach out to me directly in the OpenAir discord.

## Base

This is the main piece of Synthwave, and is responsible for consuming the majority of the filament. It's a big piece:
Around 320x320x235mm, and will require about half a roll of filament (500g) if printed at 10% infill.

You'll notice several mounting points. These are designed for M2 screws. I highly recommend a set of assorted M2 screws
for this project, as you may need many different lengths. Also, the holes are on the small side, so you might want to
drill them out ever so slightly to allow the screws to bite.

## Container cover

This sits on top of the two 32oz deli containers, and acts as a place to hold a pH probe and a pair of electrodes.
You'll notice a circle on either side: These are designed to slip over the two micro pumps in order to provide a bit
more durability.

## Back cover (optional)

This piece is designed to protect the breadboard. It is not really needed unless you want to protect the electronics.

## Pump brackets

These allow you to screw the two micro pumps to each side of the base.

## Strain relief brackets (optional)

Instead of the back cover, you can also use these brackets to help secure all of the different wires in place.

## Electrode holders

These clips are designed to hold an electrode pair 1cm apart. They're meant to allow for quick electrode swaps, and are
supposed to sit just above the water line.

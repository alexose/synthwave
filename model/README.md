# Synthwave 3D Models

The following are a few notes on how to print this design. This is not meant to be a comprehensive tutorial. More of an
FAQ. Please consider checking out the [build log](https://www.openairforum.org/t/synthwave-build-log/904) for additional
guidance.

If you're having trouble with the build process, I encourage you to reach out to me directly in the OpenAir discord.

## Base

This is the main piece of Synthwave, and is responsible for consuming the majority of the filament. It's a big piece:
Around 320x320x235mm, and will require about half a roll of filament (500g) if printed at 10% infill.

If you don't have a big enough printer, you may use the base_no_lid.stl file. This model should print on a
standard-sized printer, but it requires you to purchase a lid for your five-gallon bucket and drill two holes in it.
These holes should line up with the flush valves. Done correctly, the flush valves will hold everything in place.

You'll notice several mounting points. These are designed for M2 screws. I highly recommend a set of assorted
self-tapping M2 screws for this project, as you may need many different lengths. Also, the holes are on the small side,
so you might want to drill them out ever so slightly to allow the screws to bite.

## Container cover

This sits on top of the two 32oz deli containers, and acts as a place to hold a pH probe, a float switch, and a pair of
electrodes.

## Pump brackets

These allow you to screw the two micro pumps to each side of the base.

## Electrode holders

These clips are designed to hold an electrode pair 1cm apart. They're meant to allow for quick electrode swaps, and are
supposed to sit just above the water line.

## Back cover (optional)

This piece is designed to protect the breadboard. It is not really needed unless you want to protect the electronics.

## Strain relief brackets (optional)

Instead of the back cover, you can also use these brackets to help secure all of the different wires in place.
